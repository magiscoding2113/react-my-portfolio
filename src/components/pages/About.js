      <p> Hello, My name is Mariana Tapia. I spent 10 years in the Medical field mostly in Customer Service and more recently in Billing. 
        Within the last year I decided to make a change and have been studying at UCSD extension coding bootcamp to receive a certificate as a Full-Stack Developer. 
        I enjoy a challenge and learning and this has definitely been that, please take a moment to view my Portfolio.</p>
